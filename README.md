This repository is a Matlab implementation of the paper "Smooth Feedback Construction Over Spherical Polytopes".
These files have been tested for Matlab versions later than 2017b.

Run 'one_chart_case.m' directly to test feedback construction for spherical polytopes in one chart.
Run 'two_charts_case.m' directly to test feedback construction for spherical polytopes in two charts.
